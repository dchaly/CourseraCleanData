Project on Get and Clean Data
=============================

Coursera's Project Assignment on Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

The project contains following files:

1. run_analysis.R - the main file which gets and cleans data. The file contains the following functions:

 1. getnclean() - gets all the data and generates one dataset with train and test data
 2. getavgdata(alldf) - creates second dataset with average for each ariable for each activity and each subject (alldf is the data frame generated by getnclean())
 3. savecleandata() - cleans and saves all the data to csv files: activity_data.csv, activity_data_avg.csv. You should execute this function to get clean data.
 
2. Codebook.md - the Codebook file.

3. activity_data.csv - cleaned data file

4. activity_data_avg.csv - cleaned average data file
